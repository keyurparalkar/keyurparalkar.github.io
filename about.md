        Hi! I am Keyur Paralkar a deep learning enthusiasts. I am very passionate about building new stuffs especially when it comes to deep learning. Computer Vision is my main area of interest. I like to build deep learning models that would solve the generalized and unique problems. Apart from this I love to build some cool side projects, porting these models to different IoT and mobile devices and compete on Kaggle.

        I love to Run, swim and read autobiographies. I LOVE SPOTIFY!!!.
